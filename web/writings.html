                    This is more than a story, it’s a journey I took without even knowing. The first quarter of 2018 was a very awesome and
                    thrilling period of my life. I just got this huge role with an amazing FMCG company which meant a lot to me at that
                    time.</p>
                    <p class="display-text-two"> For a young chap at that time, just trying to find his feet, I tell you, this was huge. It involved me changing my
                    location, which I was so happy to do.
                    I had just one thing on my mind back then which was “growing through the ranks in the cooperate ladder”.
                    But something dramatic happened, I birth something new. Two weeks on my new role, I just fell out of love with it, it
                    all became an anticlimax.</p>

                    <p class="display-text-two"> I had a newfound love, career-wise, and it was Software Engineering, so I took the deep dive and changed my route. No
                    one earlier coached me on “tips for a career change”, so I struggled initially.
                    I was this consistent young boy :) coding every day without a mentor. I later resigned a year and four months after and
                    decided to get into the tech scene wholeheartedly, and since then I haven’t looked back.</p>

                    <p class="display-text-two"> My advice to young people who are thinking of having a career change is that they should strengthen their transferable
                    skills portfolio, yea it does come in handy. Just do what you love and be unapologetic.</p>

                    that state is very tragic. The pain stained on the mind is so hard to let go, thus depression sets in. You are forced
                    into a valley of indescribable thoughts, then you start to ponder, you wonder how the power of emptiness ate deep right
                    through you, this is a story of a young boy who was left alone in the dark with nothing but a mark of rejection.</p>
                    <p class="display-text-two"> This crisis is abominable, the chaos so unimaginable. Looking for who will draw out this pain he was raged, so he sorts
                    help from a sage, the one in which everyone talked about. The sage asked ‘do you have an ally?’ he said ‘no, I am all
                    alone’, the sage soliloquizes ‘little wonder’.</p>
        
                    <p class="display-text-two"> He was asked to come back in 3 days, but that was the last of the young boy, his mind now wonders with an unlikely ally
                    called depression. He left a note on his last day, the deep truth of a past he thought could go away.</p>
