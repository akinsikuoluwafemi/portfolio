                that was my first deep dive into anything software, I learned a lot during the program, and I was happy to be a part of
                it.</p>

                I was happy to have offered technical help to my learners either directly or indirectly and monitored their progress
                during the program on the Open Classroom platform, I wouldn't have done this without the support of my awesome Program
                Assistants (Emma Odia and Racheal Onoja).</p>
